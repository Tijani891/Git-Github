# Git-Github

## Introduction

This README provides step-by-step instructions for fixing a bug by merging changes from two different branches in a Git repository. Merging branches is a common practice to integrate code changes from feature branches into the main branch.

## Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of Git and its commands.
- Access to the Git repository with the bug to be fixed.
- Git installed on your local machine.

## Steps to Fix the Bug

### 1. Identify the Bug

- Begin by identifying the bug that needs to be fixed.

### 2. Create a Bug-Fix Branch

- Create a new branch for the bug fix. For example:

  ```bash
  git checkout -b bug-fix-branch
  ```

  Replace `bug-fix-branch` with a meaningful name for your branch for example your fullname[Firstname-Lastname].

### 3. Make the Necessary Changes

- Make the required code changes to fix the bug in your `bug-fix-branch`.

### 4. Commit Your Changes

- Stage,commit and push your changes with a descriptive commit message:

  ```bash
  git add .
  git commit -m "Fix: Describe the bug and the fix in detail."
  git push
  ```

### 5. Update Your Branch

- Before merging, ensure that your branch is up-to-date with the latest changes from the main branch:

  ```bash
  git checkout main  # Switch to the main branch
  git pull           # Fetch the latest changes
  ```

### 6. Merge the Bug-Fix Branch

- Merge your bug-fix branch into the main branch:

  ```bash
  git merge bug-fix-branch
  ```

- If there are conflicts, resolve them by editing the conflicted files. After resolving conflicts, commit the changes.

### 7. Push the Changes

- Once you're satisfied with the fix and have tested it, push the changes to the remote repository:

  ```bash
  git push origin main

  ```
